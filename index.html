				<h3 class="parties">Introduction </h3>
					<p class="sous-partie" >
						There are many film awards and, from the point of view of countries, the fact that a film is awarded or nominated increases the country's international influence. Obtaining an award widens the audience, leading to a better knowledge of a specific country or the desire to discover it. An award is of course a considerable price for directors, actors, actresses and all the team involved but also for the country who hosts it. <br />
						Ireland and Croatia are examples of those countries that have seen their tourists number explode thanks to the famous “Game of Thrones” series. New Zealand recorded a 40% increase in tourism between 2000 and 2006 with his “Lord of the Rings”, notably the town of Hobbiton. Moreover Kazakhstan just after “Borat” with a 300% increase in tourism. There is also Marseille in France with “Plus Belle la Vie”, Miami in USA with “Dexter”, Albuquerque with “Breaking Bad”, Tunisia with “Stars Wars” and many others.<br /><br />
						One may therefore wonder to what extent the ceramonies reflect the cinematographic tendencies of the countries.<br /><br />
						It is an attempt to capture by country a certain trend of cinematographic interest of its population, these productions and then their international renown over a century. Cinematographic trends are represented by film genres such as Dramas or Science-Fiction. By doing so, we would like to observe if a film-producing country is gradually changing the type of film it hosts in order to be more represented during the film award ceremonies.<br />
						In order to answer this problematic, we first want to report on the relationship between films and countries by considering that a country is linked to an event if and only if at least one film or person from that country has been nominated for an award at that event. Also we will analyze what an event is in order to report on how a country is represented by an event. In this way, we will see in a second step how a country's film trends have evolved over time compared to the evolution of these nominations and awards in events. Finally, our analysis will lead us to describe by period the distribution of genres by country in relation to the distribution of genres by event winners and nominees.
					</p>
				<h3 class="parties">Context- Which countries are represented in which
					film ceremonies over time </h3>
					<h4>Main goal</h4>
					<p class="sous-partie">
						The network is a Bipartite Graph representing countries involved in the most famous film award ceremonies. The Sequence Sunbursts generated by clicking on an event node represent the composition of the targeted ceremonies : the prices with their winners/nominees and film/people distributions. These aim to answer to how the countries are linked to the film award ceremonies.
					</p>
					<h4>Story</h4>
					<p class="sous-partie">
						In the network, an event is linked to a country if and only if at least a film or a person from this country has been nominated for a price of this event in a pre-selected year. We considered 9 of the most famous events and each network takes into account the twenty most represented countries in the events during the selected year. Through the network of 2019 we can see for example that the USA are implied in every event. This can be explained by the huge movie industry of that country. On the opposite, Ireland is only involved in 4 events : the Academy, BAFAT, Satellite and Sundance Film Awards. Also, more generally we observe that each event is linked to a lot of countries, which shows the globalisation of this industry and hence shows the importance of it for the influence of countries. This density can be compared to the one in 1979 : the network of that time is less dense and involves only 6 events. <br />
						If we now observe the composition of the Academy Awards in 2019, we see that they mainly consist of the Oscars which mostly reward films. The Cannes Film Festival is much more complex, as it consists of many more prizes. Similarly they mostly reward films. The Satellite Awards are the only event that rewards approximately as many films as people. Globally there is always more nominees than winners, that is expected as for example in the Oscar for the best Film in the Academy Awards of 2019 had one winner for 7 nominees. By oberserving other times, we can conclude that the composition of an event is not fixed : the number of prizes and the distributions can vary throught time.

					<h4>Main goal</h4>
					<p class="sous-partie">
						The section aims to correlate the films produced by country according to their genre and the
						awards
						received over time.
						</br>
						<i>Has a country been able to change the type of film it produces in order to have a better
							cinematic impact?</i>
					<h4>Story</h4>
					<div class="sous-partie">
						<h5>Pic of history impact in Iraq</h5>
						<p>Observe a pic of an historical film production around 2011
							-2012, only time this kind of film was produced and primed.
							The corresponding film is Bahman Ghobadi's 'Fasle kargadan', a big success film with 6 wins
							and 6 nominations in
							Asian Film Awards(2013), Chicago International Film Festival (2012), Tallinn Back Nights
							Film Festival (2012). <br />
							Marker of an intellectual revolution at work in Iraq through cinema.
						</p>
						<h5>Strong diversity in France</h5>
						<p>
							It can be noted that France produces almost all possible genres and each of these genres
							follow the same evolution, with the renown in agreement. <br\>
								More films, more renown. We can therefore deduce that in addition to being a major film
								producer, the films are of high quality.
						</p>
						<h5>Comedia in Russia</h5>
						<p>
							We can observe that comedy is a very widespread genre in the films produced (click on By
							proportion)
							Soviet comedy films are part of the world's film heritage.
							Russia, with its history marked by tragic episodes, has been able to place humour at the
							heart of its traditional and here Soviet film culture.

				<div class='inner'>
					<p>
						After accumulating the general information with the two above visualizations, one may ask
						himself how did the repartition of the countries, linked with the film genres, evolve
						through time based on if the movie has been nominated or has won in the most prestigious
						film ceremonies. What is the proportion of french drama movies that have won in the 60's? How
						many
						comedy movies have been nominated these past 10 years in the USA?
					</p>
					<h4>How to use</h4>
					<p class="sous-partie">
						You can explore the questions stated above as well as many others in the visualization presented
						just below.
						You can first start by selecting some time range you want to explore by clicking on one of the
						many ranges in the timeline.
						You can then hover on one colorful line to get more details about the proportion of movies
						sharing the attributes where the line goes through.
						One is also able to change the order of the parallel planes by clicking and moving one attribute
						to another place
						on the line it is on. This way, you are able to get many other insights that interest you.
