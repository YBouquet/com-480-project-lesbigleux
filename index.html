		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			When the Oscar ceremony become questionnable, what can we learn from Cinema?
			This work is an attempt to illustrate and ask multiple question about cinema,
			culture, tendance in general.
			From a serie of datasets, we manage to ask collected data about tacit rules
			that are often kept deeply into our mind.

		</p>
		<p>
			Let show how Oscar title can be predictible. Let show how actor will be reduced
			to certain role by their social condition or even more their birth.

			Our datasets have been collected from the platform Kaggle.

			Read more <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/iwooloowi/film-awards-imdb">about our IMDB award datasets</a>
			or the <a href="data.html">sources of our data</a>.

			Both datasets have been updated less than 2 months ago.
		</p>

		<h4>How to use</h4>
		<p>
			Here we would tell you how to interact with the plot below.
			Sadly, it is not interactive at this stage of the project.
			Please imagine that the plot is interactive and that clicking on it
			activates captivating animations.
