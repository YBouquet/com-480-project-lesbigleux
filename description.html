				<h3 class="parties">Through a cinema perspective, we aspire to analyse general movies trends
					over time and by
					country.</h3>


				<p>
					Our project will take the form of a main visualization (sketch 1) around which the user will be
					able to ask several questions.
					With our visualization, we will show the distribution of the country of production of the film
					awarded with the most famous ceremonies throughout time. It is an attempt to capture by country
					a certain trend of cinematographic interest of its population, these productions and then their
					international renown over a century.
					Today there are many film awards and, from the point of view of countries, the fact that a film
					is awarded or nominated increases the country's international influence. Obtaining an award
					widens the audience, leading to a better knowledge of a specific country or the desire to
					discover it. An award is of course a considerable price for directors, actors, actresses and all
					the team involved but also for the country who hosts it. <br />
				</p>
				<p>
					Ireland and Croatia are examples of those countries that have seen their tourists number explode
					thanks to the famous “Game of Thrones” series. New Zealand recorded a 40% increase in tourism
					between 2000 and 2006 with his “Lord of the Rings”, notably the town of Hobbiton. Moreover
					Kazakhstan just after “Borat” with a 300% increase in tourism. There is also Marseille in France
					with “Plus Belle la Vie”, Miami in USA with “Dexter”, Albuquerque with “Breaking Bad”, Tunisia
					with “Stars Wars” and many others.<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					So who are theses countries that observe new tourism trends from cinematographic recompenses?
					How do they evolve over time?<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					The available datasets do not allow us to illustrate the correlation between the tourist
					development of a country and the cinematic rewards received. Tourism is here only an additional
					motivation for our project: visualizing the link between the countries of production and the
					rewards received by the films produced.<br />
					To this link between country and film ceremony we have added the dimensionality of film
					categories. By doing so, we would like to observe with a timeline if a film-producing country is
					gradually changing the type of film it hosts in order to have better audiences. Since many
					awards are based on public audiences or are followed by a general improvement in public interest
					in the film, we can assume that the proportion of films nominated in the categories through
					ceremonies influences the current film trends of the population. A blockbuster will be screened
					worldwide and therefore contributes to increase the appeal of a particular genre. This is even
					more convincing for series, as many countries begin to debate and watch the same world series
					for a period of time. “Game of Thrones” can be again a good example of this correlation between
					awards and audience as they have 16.1M of spectator 38 Emmy Awards and 129 nominations.
					If such a correlation is confirmed, which ceremonies are targeted? In fact, we can imagine that
					some categories will have greater chance of being nominated at specific ceremonies (depending on
					the award category) but is it true? Our main visualisation will show the distribution of film
					categories through ceremonies or countries over time.
				</p>
				<h3 class="parties">Its purpose?</h3>
				<p>Could be a new tool for trends analysis by considering film prices as country
					indicators. It can help the director to better choose where to present his film according to
					its
					category and home production. Moreover, it can be a simple curiosity for a cinema-lover or
					anybody looking for new visualisation of the world of film awards.</p>
