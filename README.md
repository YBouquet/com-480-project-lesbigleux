# Project of Data Visualization (COM-480 EPFL)

## Goal
Cinema is one of the many fascinating environments which is constantly evolving. It is such a powerful tool that allows storytellers to bring their beautiful narratives to life. If a picture is worth a thousand words, surely a film is worth a million.

By the late 19th century, the movie camera was born and allowed the creation of the many moving films that can be seen on screen. It has been evolving through many genres, allowing many movie lovers to feel many emotions by having different experiences.

As this environment has evolved through a whole century, many countries have been having their own movie trends. It has also allowed to the country to benefit from it in an economical way by participating in many movie ceremonies and receiving famous awards.

Therefore, our project and different implemented visualizations try to answer to the following question: *How has a country’s film trends evolved over time through the prism of ceremonies and rewards?*

## Datasets
To be able to implement the visualizations, we used the following datasets of IMDB, the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content:
* [IMDB Awards](https://www.kaggle.com/iwooloowi/film-awards-imdb)
* [IMDB Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset)

## Team members
* Yann Yanis Bouquet, 273827
* Emma Lanctuit, 274894
* Gonxhe Idrizi, 275001
