					<h2 class="cover-heading">Dataset</h2>
					<p> A first dataset we will explore is the film Award from IMDB which contains awards from 1886 to
						2020.
						As our project will focus on an evolution through time, having such a range of data will be
						useful
						but we have to consider disparity due to event existence. <br /><i>What is the existence period
							of
							each
							event
							pre-selected to these days?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						Most frequent and relevant events in the dataset are, by preprocessing: Emmy Awards, BAFTA
						Awards,
						Academy Awards (USA), News & Documentary Emmy Awards, Online Film & Television Association,
						Grammy
						Awards, Cannes Film Festival, Gold Derby Awards, Berlin International Film Festival, Gemini
						Awards,
						Leo Awards, Adult Video News Awards, Young Artist Awards. We notice a distinction between the
						Event
						and Award names as some awards names might be more meaningful than their associated events. If
						we
						take the Oscar for exemple, theses are awards delivered during the Academy Awards. This is a
						nuance
						that we will have to investigate in order to make our visualization as relevant as possible.
						<br /><i>How
							many awards are there per event?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						This dataset also contains distinction between primary and secondary prices. For the scope of
						our
						visualisation we retain only primary prizes awarded to film or people. In order to have an
						unbiased
						result, we are also interested in the proportion of nominees or winners for each of the
						ceremonies
						selected for our study (i.e. most frequent/popular).
						<br /><i>How much information we lose if we reduce
							our
							study to the winners?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						To join awards information with movies country production we are using the dataset of IMDB
						Movies
						that contains around 80 000 films. Since our study period extends over a century, we have to
						manually change the names of countries that no longer exist as Soviet Union for Russia, West
						Germany
						for Germany… We hope that the majority of the films/persons nominated in the most popular
						ceremonies
						of the last 100 years will be present in this dataset. In this purpose, as we are distinguishing
						nominations from their country-production aspect it can be interesting to know : How many movies
						are
						represented by country in the IMDB dataset? A country not present in this dataset will most
						likely
						not be represented in our visualization.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can find here the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/iwooloowi/film-awards-imdb">IMDB Awards

					<p>
						During our dataset analysis, multiple questions were raised that we tried to answer through some
						visualisations of our data. There is two main endpoints in our visualisation : Film-producing
						countries and Events/Awards.<br />
						We have to decide whether to consider the event or its awards as it changes the access to our
						visualization. We need a name that speaks to the largest number of people and at the same time
						makes sense from the point of view of our cinematic study. Considering the event rather than the
						award leads to a difference in the selected ceremonies and therefore in the total distribution
						of our countries. This is a major decision in the relevance of our final visualization.
						<br /><i>How many awards are there per event?</i>

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container">
					<img width=500px height=auto src="./Preprocess/figures/awards_by_event.jpeg">
				</div>
				<p>

					Our next analysis concern the feasibility of our visualisation considering one century of
					evolution over Cinema Awards.
					<br /><i>What is the existence period of each event pre-selected to these days?</i>

				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<row>
						<img width=450px height=auto src="./Preprocess/figures/activity_periods_by_awards.jpeg">
						<img width=450px height=auto src="./Preprocess/figures/activity_periods_by_event.jpeg">
					</row>
				</div>
				<p>


					We observe that we should have enough data to cover all the century in a representative way.
					Note that awards followed the repartition of event as expected. Moreover some name coincides and
					taking the awards instead of event name doesn’t seems to include any biais here.<br />

					Having relevant visualisation imply to use relevant data. Is it pertinent to consider winners
					and nominees, can we reduce our sample to winners as there are the most impacted by an award?
					<br /><i>How much information we lose if we reduce our study to the winners?</i>

				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<row>
						<img width=450px height=auto src="./Preprocess/figures/total_primary_by_award.jpeg">
						<img width=450px height=auto src="./Preprocess/figures/total_primary_by_event.jpeg">
					</row>
				</div>
				<p>

					Here again the distinction between events and awards doesn’t seem to have a notable impact on
					our data repartition. However we saw that we are losing a huge part of data by only selecting
					winners. Keeping both remains appropriate to our goal since a nominated film will still have
					more visibility than one without a price.<br />

					An overview of the biases that could be included by considering only nominated films and not
					people was also an important subject. This would make it easier for us to match the actor's
					nomination with the country of production of the film in which he or she was nominated.

				</p>
				<div class="container">
					<row>
						<img width=450px height=auto
							src="./Preprocess/figures/titles_persons_distributions_by_award.jpeg">
						<img width=450px height=auto
							src="./Preprocess/figures/titles_persons_distributions_by_event.jpeg">

					</row>
				</div>
				<p>


					From this visualisation, we get that one more time the distinction between awards or event
					doesn’t change the global repartition. This confirm us in the fact that most popular awards are
					linked to most popular events. However is show us that by deleting people from our study we risk
					considerably influencing the total distribution of awards and thus our countries of production.
					<br />

					As we link our award dataset to our film dataset in purpose to match award to film-producing
					country, we have to make sure that we have enough countries represented in our IMDB dataset to
					conduct an interesting study.
