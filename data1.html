					<h2 class="cover-heading">Dataset</h2>
					<p> A first dataset we will explore is the film Award from IMDB which contains awards from 1886 to
						2020.
						As our project will focus on an evolution through time, having such a range of data will be
						useful
						but we have to consider disparity due to event existence. <br /><i>What is the existence period
							of
							each
							event
							pre-selected to these days?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						Most frequent and relevant events in the dataset are, by preprocessing: Emmy Awards, BAFTA
						Awards,
						Academy Awards (USA), News & Documentary Emmy Awards, Online Film & Television Association,
						Grammy
						Awards, Cannes Film Festival, Gold Derby Awards, Berlin International Film Festival, Gemini
						Awards,
						Leo Awards, Adult Video News Awards, Young Artist Awards. We notice a distinction between the
						Event
						and Award names as some awards names might be more meaningful than their associated events. If
						we
						take the Oscar for exemple, theses are awards delivered during the Academy Awards. This is a
						nuance
						that we will have to investigate in order to make our visualization as relevant as possible.
						<br /><i>How
							many awards are there per event?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						This dataset also contains distinction between primary and secondary prices. For the scope of
						our
						visualisation we retain only primary prizes awarded to film or people. In order to have an
						unbiased
						result, we are also interested in the proportion of nominees or winners for each of the
						ceremonies
						selected for our study (i.e. most frequent/popular).
						<br /><i>How much information we lose if we reduce
							our
							study to the winners?</i>
					</p>
					<p>

						To join awards information with movies country production we are using the dataset of IMDB
						Movies
						that contains around 80 000 films. Since our study period extends over a century, we have to
						manually change the names of countries that no longer exist as Soviet Union for Russia, West
						Germany
						for Germanyâ€¦ We hope that the majority of the films/persons nominated in the most popular
						ceremonies
						of the last 100 years will be present in this dataset. In this purpose, as we are distinguishing
						nominations from their country-production aspect it can be interesting to know : How many movies
						are
						represented by country in the IMDB dataset? A country not present in this dataset will most
						likely
						not be represented in our visualization.
